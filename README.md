# AI-Powered Customer Support System

## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered customer support system using a multi-agent architecture.
A router agent analyzes incoming queries and delegates them to specialized agents:
Support Agent, Order Agent, and Billing Agent.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Hono (TypeScript)
- Frontend: React (Vite)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- AI: Vercel AI SDK
- Infrastructure: Docker

## Architecture
- Controller–Service pattern
- Clean separation of concerns
- Multi-agent routing with tool-based agents
- Persistent conversation context

## Current Status (WIP)
🚧 This repository is **work in progress**.
- Project structure initialized
- Backend scaffolding in progress
- Docker + PostgreSQL setup underway

The complete implementation (agents, tools, streaming, and UI) will be finalized and pushed shortly.

## Submission Note
Due to time constraints on the submission day, this repository is shared in its current state.
All remaining features will be completed and committed in follow-up updates.
